    "situationSummary": "Jon, you are running a 76\u2013150 person internal business services team with strong foundations: documented processes, trusted data, embedded AI adoption, and an integrated platform. Yet you are still losing time to coordination overhead, handoff friction, and rework. The invisible work is coordination itself: chasing updates, reconciling information across systems, managing scope drift as projects move between people. Your team is capable, but the connective tissue between tasks is manual.",
    "priorityMapIntro": "Your diagnostic revealed a pattern: the work itself is not the problem, the handoffs are. Three workflows emerged as high-impact starting points because they all involve moving information between people, systems, or stages. Project delivery coordination and proposal scoping scored almost identically \u2014 both accumulate signal from multiple pain points you named. Management reporting ranked third, with the highest automation potential of the three.",

        "name": "Project delivery coordination",
        "whyThisMatters": "You described late information, handoff friction, inconsistent quality, and workarounds for system limitations. These are not separate problems. They are symptoms of the same root cause: project coordination relies on manual status updates, ad-hoc communication, and people remembering to pass things on. For an internal services team with 65% client-facing work, every delay compounds. AI can automate the connective tissue: status synthesis, handoff triggers, quality checks at transition points.",

        },
        "currentState": "Project status lives in multiple places: your integrated platform, email threads, Slack channels, someone's head. Updates are manual. When work moves between people, context gets lost. Quality depends on who picks it up because there is no automated quality gate at handoff points. You work around system limitations because building the workflow logic manually would take too long.",
        "futureState": "AI monitors your platform and communication channels to synthesise project status in real time. When a task completes, the system triggers the next handoff automatically and surfaces the context the next person needs. Quality checks run at transition points: scope against original brief, deliverable against template, timeline against plan. Senior people get exception alerts, not status requests. The platform becomes intelligent infrastructure, not just a database.",
        "considerations": "Your integrated platform is an advantage here: AI can read structured data and trigger workflows without requiring new systems. The challenge is defining what constitutes a handoff and what context needs to travel with it. You will need to map your current project stages explicitly, even if they feel obvious. Start with one project type, prove the pattern, then extend.",

        "whyThisMatters": "You flagged proposals for both coordination overhead and rework. That combination is diagnostic: the process involves multiple contributors (hence coordination), and the output often needs revision (hence rework). For an internal services team, every proposal cycle that drags on delays revenue recognition or capacity allocation. AI can compress the cycle by automating research, pricing consistency checks, and document generation, while keeping human judgment on scope and risk.",

        },
        "currentState": "Proposals are inaccurate and time-consuming because they require pulling information from past projects, reconciling pricing across similar scopes, and coordinating input from multiple people. Rework happens when pricing is inconsistent, scope is ambiguous, or someone spots an error late in the review cycle. Senior people bottleneck the process because they hold the pricing logic and risk judgment in their heads.",
        "futureState": "AI drafts proposals by retrieving comparable past projects, applying your documented pricing framework, and generating scope narratives based on the brief. Pricing consistency checks run automatically: if this scope is priced differently from a similar one last month, the system flags it. Senior review focuses on risk and client fit, not formatting and arithmetic. Rework drops because the first draft is already 80% accurate.",
        "considerations": "Your strong process documentation and data foundations mean AI can learn your pricing patterns and scope templates quickly. The risk is over-automating: proposals still need human judgment on client context and risk. Define clearly where AI assists (research, drafting, consistency checks) and where humans decide (scope boundaries, pricing strategy, risk appetite). Start with internal proposals or lower-stakes scopes to build confidence.",

        "whyThisMatters": "You described reporting as never on time and inaccurate, with scope creep and handoff friction contributing to the problem. Management reporting is infrastructure: it underpins decision-making across the organisation. When reports are late or inaccurate, leadership loses confidence in the data, and the team wastes time defending numbers instead of acting on them. AI can automate the data reconciliation, formatting, and distribution, freeing your team to focus on insight rather than compilation.",

          "learning": "red"
        },
        "currentState": "Reports are compiled manually by pulling data from your integrated platform, reconciling discrepancies, and formatting for leadership. Scope expands because stakeholders request additional cuts or comparisons mid-cycle. Handoff friction occurs when the person compiling the report needs input from project leads or finance. The process is reliable in structure but fragile in execution: if one data source is late, the whole report is late.",
        "futureState": "AI pulls data from your platform on a schedule, applies your reporting templates, and flags anomalies for human review before distribution. Scope creep is managed by versioning: the core report runs automatically, and ad-hoc requests are logged as separate queries. Leadership gets consistent, on-time reports with commentary generated by AI and reviewed by your team. The hours saved (up to 75% of current effort) get redirected to analysis and insight.",
        "considerations": "Your integrated platform and strong data foundations make this workflow highly automatable. The complexity is not technical, it is organisational: defining what reports are mandatory versus ad-hoc, and training stakeholders to trust automated output. You will need to run parallel reporting (manual and automated) for a transition period to build confidence. Start with one high-frequency report (weekly utilisation, monthly revenue) and prove the pattern.",
