{"status":"success","report":{"id":"fb2e9aed-125f-40a6-a6c0-950ab5f8793a","situationSummary":"Jon, you are running a clinical trial equipment and logistics operation with 76–150 people, strong foundations in place, and a clear problem: your team is spending too much time on coordination, rework, and chasing information instead of delivering client value. You described late and inaccurate information across project delivery, proposals, and reporting — three areas where the invisible work of coordination is eating capacity you cannot afford to lose. The good news: your process documentation, data quality, and integrated platform mean you are well-positioned to address this systematically.","priorityMapIntro":"We scored nine workflow archetypes against your diagnostic inputs and ranked them by impact, feasibility, and learning value. Two workflows emerged as equally strong starting points: project delivery coordination and proposal and scoping. Both address the coordination overhead and information quality issues you flagged, and both sit on solid foundations. Management reporting ranked third — it accumulates signal from multiple pain points and offers the highest automation potential of the three.","workflows":[{"archetypeId":"project-delivery-coordination","name":"Project delivery coordination","whyThisMatters":"You flagged three distinct symptoms in project delivery: handoff friction when work moves between teams, inconsistent quality depending on who picks it up, and workarounds for system limitations. These are not separate problems. They are symptoms of the same root cause: the coordination layer between your integrated platform and your people is manual. Late information compounds every other issue. Fixing the coordination workflow addresses all three.","impactPotential":"high","implementationComplexity":"medium","threeConditionsCheck":{"impact":"green","complexity":"green","learning":"amber"},"currentState":"Your team is managing clinical trial logistics across multiple sites and countries using a fully integrated platform, but the platform does not manage itself. Someone is still chasing updates, reconciling status across teams, flagging blockers, and ensuring handoffs happen cleanly. When information arrives late — equipment delayed at customs, site readiness changes, protocol amendments — the coordination overhead multiplies. Quality depends on who is managing the project because the platform captures data but does not enforce process.","futureState":"AI monitors your platform in real time, flags exceptions before they become blockers, and routes information to the right people at the right time. Status updates are generated automatically from platform data. Handoffs are triggered by workflow state, not manual follow-up. Your team shifts from chasing information to acting on it. The platform becomes self-managing for routine coordination, freeing your people to handle the complexity that requires judgment: customs issues, site-specific constraints, protocol deviations.","considerations":"Your integrated platform is a strength here, but it also means the AI layer needs to work with your existing workflows, not replace them. The biggest decision will be where to draw the line between automated coordination and human judgment. Clinical trial logistics involves regulatory and safety considerations that cannot be fully automated. The goal is not to remove people from the loop, but to remove the manual coordination work that prevents them from focusing on the decisions that matter.","prerequisites":["Identifiable project stages and handoff points in your platform","Clear ownership of coordination tasks (even if informal)","Access to platform data for pattern extraction"],"pitfalls":["Over-automating handoffs that require contextual judgment (e.g. customs clearance issues)","Assuming the platform's workflow engine can handle all coordination logic without AI augmentation","Underestimating the change management required to shift from manual to AI-assisted coordination"]},{"archetypeId":"proposal-scoping","name":"Proposal and scoping","whyThisMatters":"You described proposals as time-consuming and inaccurate, with too much coordination overhead and rework. This workflow accumulates signal from three pain points: work-about-work in proposals, rework from miscommunication, and scope creep in reporting. The connection: inaccurate scoping at the proposal stage creates downstream problems in delivery and reporting. Fixing the front end reduces rework across the entire client lifecycle.","impactPotential":"high","implementationComplexity":"low","threeConditionsCheck":{"impact":"green","complexity":"green","learning":"green"},"currentState":"Your team is scoping clinical trial equipment and logistics requirements based on study protocols, site specifications, and regulatory constraints. The process involves research (equipment availability, customs requirements, site capabilities), pricing (rental rates, logistics costs, contingency), and document generation (proposals, SOWs, equipment lists). Much of this is done manually, even though you have templates and past proposals to reference. Inaccurate scoping — underestimating equipment lead times, missing customs requirements, mispricing logistics — creates rework downstream when reality does not match the proposal.","futureState":"AI assists with research and pricing by extracting patterns from past proposals, flagging common scoping errors, and generating first-draft equipment lists and cost estimates based on protocol requirements. Your team reviews and refines, adding judgment on site-specific constraints and client preferences. Proposals are faster and more accurate because the AI catches the details that humans miss under time pressure. Scope creep reduces because the scoping process is more rigorous upfront.","considerations":"Your well-documented processes and strong data foundations mean this workflow can move quickly. The main decision is how much of the scoping process to AI-assist versus fully automate. Equipment availability and customs requirements change frequently, so the AI will need access to live data sources or regular updates. Pricing logic will need to reflect your commercial strategy, not just cost recovery. The goal is to free senior people from first-draft work, not to remove them from client-facing scoping conversations.","prerequisites":["Access to past proposals for pattern extraction","Clear pricing framework (even if it varies by client or study type)","Identifiable scoping steps and decision points"],"pitfalls":["Automating pricing without encoding commercial judgment (e.g. strategic discounting, client relationship factors)","Assuming AI can scope complex multi-site trials without human oversight","Underestimating the time required to train the AI on your specific equipment and logistics constraints"]},{"archetypeId":"management-reporting","name":"Management reporting","whyThisMatters":"You flagged reporting as never on time and inaccurate, with scope creep and handoff friction contributing to the problem. This workflow sits downstream of the other two: inaccurate proposals create scope creep, and poor project coordination creates handoff friction that reporting has to reconcile. Management reporting is where the coordination tax becomes visible to leadership. It is also the most automatable of the three workflows, with 75% of the work being data entry and reconciliation.","impactPotential":"medium","implementationComplexity":"high","threeConditionsCheck":{"impact":"amber","complexity":"amber","learning":"red"},"currentState":"Your team is pulling data from your integrated platform to produce reports on utilisation, revenue, pipeline, project status, and equipment availability. The platform captures the data, but someone still has to extract it, reconcile discrepancies, format it for leadership, and add narrative context. Reports are late because the data is not always clean or complete. They are inaccurate because manual reconciliation introduces errors. Leadership does not fully trust the numbers because the process is opaque and inconsistent.","futureState":"AI generates reports directly from platform data, reconciles discrepancies automatically, and flags exceptions for human review. Reports are produced on schedule with consistent formatting and narrative summaries. Your team shifts from compiling reports to interpreting them: explaining variances, identifying trends, recommending actions. Leadership gets faster, more accurate information, and your team gets capacity back for higher-value analysis.","considerations":"Your integrated platform is a strength here, but it also means the reporting logic is embedded in the platform's data model. The AI will need to understand that model and handle edge cases (e.g. equipment in transit, multi-site projects, currency conversions). The biggest decision is what level of narrative context to automate versus leave to human judgment. Financial and operational reporting for clinical trials often requires regulatory context that AI cannot infer from data alone.","prerequisites":["Clear reporting requirements and formats","Access to platform data with consistent definitions","Someone who currently owns the reporting process and can validate AI output"],"pitfalls":["Automating report generation without addressing upstream data quality issues","Assuming AI can provide regulatory or strategic context without human input","Underestimating the change management required to shift leadership from manual to AI-generated reports"]}],"businessCase":{"perArea":[{"archetypeId":"project-delivery","annualHours":2700,"annualCost":125000,"recoveryRange":{"low":43750,"high":81250}},{"archetypeId":"proposal-scoping","annualHours":5400,"annualCost":250000,"recoveryRange":{"low":87500,"high":162500}},{"archetypeId":"management-reporting","annualHours":2700,"annualCost":175000,"recoveryRange":{"low":105000,"high":148750}}],"totalAnnualHours":10800,"totalAnnualCost":550000,"conservativeRecovery":{"low":236250,"high":392500},"weeklyHoursRecovered":{"low":103,"high":171},"revenueFraming":false},"maturityAssessment":{"strengths":["Your process documentation is strong — SOPs, templates, and playbooks exist for most processes, which means AI can learn from structured knowledge rather than inferring patterns from scratch.","Your data foundations are solid — consistent, accessible, and trusted for decisions — which removes the most common blocker to AI deployment.","Your team is already using AI across the organisation, so you are not starting from zero on adoption or change management."],"development":["Your integrated platform is a strength for data access, but it may also constrain how quickly you can deploy AI-assisted workflows if the platform's API or workflow engine is rigid.","Your team's AI adoption is embedded, which means you may have less appetite for process redesign than organisations earlier in the adoption curve — the risk is automating existing workflows rather than reimagining them.","Your billable split (65% client-facing) means capacity gains need to translate quickly into revenue or delivery quality improvements, not just efficiency for its own sake."]},"quickWins":["Run a retrospective with your project delivery team on the last three projects where information arrived late.
