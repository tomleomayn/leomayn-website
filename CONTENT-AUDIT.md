**CTAs:**
- Book Discovery Call
- See Our Services

### Problem Section
**Heading:** Three problems to fix first

**Card 1:**
- **Heading:** Manual work crowds out strategic work
- **Body:** Teams spend most of their day chasing updates, switching systems, and doing manual data entry. Knowledge workers spend 60% of time on work about work rather than skilled tasks [1]. Little capacity remains for strategic work that drives growth.

**Card 2:**
- **Heading:** Automating broken workflows doesn't work
- **Body:** Automating broken processes makes them faster but no less broken [2]. Technology overlaid on inefficient workflows magnifies problems rather than solving them. Fix the workflow first, then scale what works.

**Card 3:**
- **Heading:** Tool choice before diagnosis creates waste
- **Body:** Organisations waste 30% of software spending on unused licenses [3]. Selecting technology before understanding the operational problem leads to disappointing results. Diagnosis determines the right solution.

## Page: Our Approach (/approach)

### Hero Section
**Heading:** Our approach
**Tagline:** Fix the work first, then scale with AI

### Core Philosophy
**Heading:** Why operations before automation

**Body:**
- Most AI and automation projects fail because they start with the technology and work backwards to the problem. They automate broken workflows, making them faster but no less broken. They select tools before understanding constraints. They promise transformation without diagnosing what needs fixing.
- We work the other way round. We start with how your work actually runs today, identify what's broken and what matters, redesign the workflow to remove inefficiencies, and only then deploy automation to scale what works.
- This approach delivers working systems in weeks, not theoretical frameworks in months. Your team owns the result, understands how it works, and can maintain it independently.

### Three Principles
**Heading:** Three principles that guide everything we do

**1. Diagnose before prescribing:**
We don't start with solutions. We start with stakeholder interviews, process mapping, and operational analysis to understand where time and quality leak out of your workflows. Only after diagnosing the actual problem do we recommend technology or automation. This prevents expensive mistakes and ensures we solve the right problem.

**2. Design for your constraints:**
Every organisation has unique constraints: legacy systems, data quality issues, regulatory requirements, team capabilities, and governance needs. Generic solutions ignore these realities. We design workflows and automation that fit your specific environment, using tools you can own, maintain, and adapt as requirements evolve.

**3. Transfer capability, not dependency:**
We don't create ongoing dependency on proprietary platforms or consultancy retainers. You own all code, configurations, and documentation. Your team receives training to maintain and improve the system independently. The goal is to make ourselves redundant, not indispensable.

### What Makes Us Different
**Heading:** What makes us different

**vs. AI consultants:**
We fix workflows before adding AI. They start with AI and retrofit problems. We deliver working systems. They deliver strategy decks.

**vs. Automation agencies:**
We include change management and governance. They just build tools. We transfer capability. They create dependency.

**vs. Management consultancies:**
We actually build things. They deliver recommendations. We charge fixed prices. They bill hourly with scope creep.

**vs. Software vendors:**
We design for your constraints. They sell generic products. You own our work. They rent you licenses.

### How We Work
**Heading:** How we work with you

**Body:**
- We work alongside your team, not in isolation. You're involved throughout: reviewing process maps, approving designs, testing systems before deployment, and learning to maintain what we build.
- Projects are priced based on complexity, not hours. You know the cost before we start. No surprises, no scope creep, no hourly rate anxiety. Clear scope, clear deliverables, clear timeline.
- You can pause between phases. Complete a diagnosis and decide whether to proceed. Get a blueprint designed and choose when to build. There's no pressure to commit to the full journey upfront.

## Page: How We Think (/how-we-think)

### Hero Section
**Heading:** How we think
**Tagline:** Principles that shape how we approach operational improvement

### Operations Before AI
**Heading:** Operations before AI

**Body:**
- AI is a lever, not a silver bullet. Without fixing the underlying workflow, AI just accelerates broken processes. We see companies rushing to implement ChatGPT or Copilot without understanding what operational problem they are solving.
- The result is predictable: pilot purgatory. Teams run experiments that show promise but never scale. Shadow IT emerges. Governance breaks down. Investment is wasted.
- We work the other way round. Fix the workflow first. Remove bottlenecks, eliminate unnecessary handoffs, clarify decision rights, and standardize where it matters. Only then does automation or AI make sense.
- This is not slower. It is faster. Because you build once, not three times. You deploy solutions that stick, not experiments that die in staging.

### Complexity Is The Enemy
**Heading:** Complexity is the enemy

**Body:**
- Most operational problems are not technical. They are organizational. Unclear ownership, duplicated effort, manual handoffs between systems, missing data, inconsistent processes across teams.
- Adding technology to this mess creates more complexity, not less. You now have the original organizational problem plus integration complexity, tool sprawl, and maintenance burden.
- Our approach strips out complexity before adding anything new. We clarify who does what, consolidate duplicated work, remove unnecessary steps, and document the simplified process.
- Then we automate the simple version. Automation on top of simplicity compounds. Automation on top of complexity collapses.

### Governance Is Not Optional
**Heading:** Governance is not optional

**Body:**
- Many automation projects skip governance because it feels like overhead. This is a mistake. Without clear data handling protocols, access controls, and audit trails, you create risk that compounds over time.
- We design governance into the solution from the start. Who can access what data? How is sensitive information protected? What gets logged? How do we prove compliance?
- This is not bureaucracy. It is insurance. Systems with clear governance scale safely. Systems without it create liability.
- For professional services firms handling client data, governance is the difference between operational leverage and operational risk.

### Transfer Capability, Not Dependency
**Heading:** Transfer capability, not dependency

**Body:**
- Many consultancies and vendors create dependency by design. Proprietary platforms, complex configurations, undocumented customizations. You cannot maintain the system without them.
- We do the opposite. Every solution is built on open platforms you can own. Every workflow is documented. Every configuration is explained. Your team receives training to maintain and improve the system independently.
- The goal is to make ourselves redundant, not indispensable. You should be able to iterate, modify, and extend what we build without coming back to us.
- This creates better outcomes. When you own the capability, you adapt faster, iterate more frequently, and compound improvements over time.

### Build For Humans
**Heading:** Build for humans

**Body:**
- Automation projects often treat people as an afterthought. The system gets built, then training happens, then adoption struggles, then the system fails.
- We design for human adoption from the start. What does the user experience? How do they learn the new workflow? What happens when they make a mistake? How do we measure success from their perspective?
- Change management is not a phase at the end. It is a constraint throughout. We do not build systems people will not use. We build systems that make their work easier, clearer, and more valuable.
- The best automation is invisible. It removes friction without adding complexity. People get better outcomes without feeling like they are using new technology.

### Measure What Matters
**Heading:** Measure what matters

**Body:**
- Many AI projects measure activity instead of outcomes. Hours saved, tasks automated, workflows digitized. These metrics miss the point.
- We measure operational leverage: Can you deliver more value with the same team? Can you maintain quality while growing revenue? Can your best people spend more time on high-value work?
- This requires different metrics. Throughput per person. Error rates. Cycle time from intake to delivery. Time spent on value creation versus administration.
- When you measure what matters, you optimize for the right things. Automation that saves time but reduces quality is not success. Automation that frees experts to focus on complex problems is.

## Page: About (/about)

### Hero Section
**Heading:** About Leomayn
**Tagline:** Operational architecture for professional services

### Our Story
**Heading:** Why Leomayn exists

**Body:**
- Leomayn was founded to solve a specific problem: professional services firms drowning in operational complexity while AI vendors promise transformation without understanding the underlying workflows.
- Most firms know their processes are broken. Manual handoffs, duplicated effort, unclear ownership, data scattered across systems. They want to fix it, but generic AI consultants start with technology and work backwards to the problem.
- We work the other way round. Fix the operational foundation first, then scale what works with automation and AI. This creates sustainable leverage, not expensive experiments that fail to scale.

### Founder
**Heading:** Founded by Tom Jones

**Body:**
- Tom has spent 20 years solving operational problems across technology, operations, and knowledge work. He has delivered operational excellence programmes for companies including Boehringer Ingelheim, Nestlé, Boston Scientific, and Everybody.
- His approach combines systems thinking with practical implementation. Diagnose the actual problem, design for real constraints, build working solutions, and transfer capability to internal teams.
- Before founding Leomayn, Tom led operations teams, built product development functions, and consulted on business transformation. He understands how professional services firms actually work, not just how they should work in theory.

### What We Believe
**Heading:** What we believe

**Operations before technology:**
Fix the workflow first. Technology amplifies what you build on top of. If the foundation is broken, automation makes things worse, not better.

**Outcomes over hours:**
We price by complexity and deliverables, not hourly rates. You know the cost before we start. No scope creep, no hourly rate anxiety, no billing surprises.

**Transfer capability, not dependency:**
You own all code, configurations, and documentation. Your team learns to maintain and improve systems independently. We make ourselves redundant, not indispensable.

**Evidence over assumptions:**
We interview stakeholders, map actual workflows, and identify real bottlenecks before recommending solutions. No generic frameworks, no cookie-cutter approaches.

### How We Work
**Heading:** How we work

**Body:**
- We work alongside your team, not in isolation. You are involved throughout: reviewing process maps, approving designs, testing systems, and learning to maintain what we build.
- Projects follow a systematic approach: Diagnose the problem, Define the solution, Deliver working systems, and Support ongoing optimization. You can pause between phases. No pressure to commit upfront to the full journey.
- We use open platforms you can own. Nothing proprietary, nothing locked to our involvement. Complete documentation, comprehensive training, and full capability transfer.

### Who We Serve
